## About the logic

This problem "Longest palindromic", I use brute force to solve this problem

Step:
* The first for loop is to use as a pointer for each char for the string input.
* The second loop is to use as a pointer for each char after the first char, the loop will run. through the string by combining each char for each loop and check wether they are palindromic or not .
* Last, will find the largest length of string to get the lasgest palindromic.
* By looping through the string and check if current and previous string length.
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!


### What to improve

Because current answer is using brute force by looping through the string.
Instead, if we use the dynamic proggramming will help reduce the time complexity.
